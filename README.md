# BattleTank
BattleTank laboratory for RMCC 4th year.

The project has been developed under Linux, use SDL2 as graphic engine and use CLion IDE. This is use as an interface so the student can send data to it using Google Protobuff and see what happen on the screen. There is no security built in on purpose since it's the student job to do so. As a stand alone program, it doesn't do much.
